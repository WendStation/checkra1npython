# checkra1npython
 Checkra1n IS NOT included in this download. That is available at checkra.in checkra1n is NOT downloaded at startup, and the checkra1n executable is expected to be under /usr/bin. It is also expected that you have a rasberry pi or other similar device DEDICATED to this task, thus the username and password is expected to be the default for the raspberry pi (user: pi, password: raspberry). This is meant to run at boot, skip login, and display over the entire system. It will be completely controlled with a mouse or touchscreen. The escape button will be used to exit the program (not yet implemented lol)

# Requirements:
- pygame
- wget
- time
